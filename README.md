📌 Repository Description
MatrixFactorizationCollaborativeFiltering is an implementation of collaborative filtering using matrix factorization techniques to build personalized recommendation systems. The project applies methods such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Alternating Least Squares (ALS), and Gradient Descent–based optimization to uncover latent user–item interactions.

✨ Key Features
Implementation of user-based and item-based collaborative filtering with matrix factorization
Support for regularization to prevent overfitting
Ability to handle sparse datasets efficiently
Integration with evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, Precision, and Recall
Example workflows for movie recommendations and custom datasets
📂 Use Cases
Movie recommendation systems 🎬
Music or product recommendations 🎵📦
Personalized content ranking and filtering
⚙️ Tech Stack
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook examples for hands-on experimentation
Optional: support for PyTorch / TensorFlow for deep learning–based extensions# MatrixFactorizationCollaborativeFiltering
