# Matrix Factorization Collaborative Filtering
Matrix Factorization Collaborative Filtering is an implementation of collaborative filtering using matrix factorization techniques to build personalized recommendation systems. The project applies methods such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Alternating Least Squares (ALS), and Gradient Descent–based optimization to uncover latent user–item interactions.

✨ Key Features
* Implementation of user-based and item-based collaborative filtering with matrix factorization
* Support for regularization to prevent overfitting
* Ability to handle sparse datasets efficiently
* Example workflows for movie recommendations and custom datasets

📂 Use Cases
* Movie recommendation systems 🎬

⚙️ Tech Stack
* Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
* Jupyter Notebook examples for hands-on experimentation
* Optional: support for PyTorch / TensorFlow for deep learning–based extensions# MatrixFactorizationCollaborativeFiltering
